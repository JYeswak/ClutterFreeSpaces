• **Garage Sale Prep**: Organizing items by category, pricing strategies, and display setup for maximum sales
• **Timeline Management**: Creating a realistic plan to get everything ready by September 13th

**My Approach for ADHD-Friendly Organizing:**

- Body doubling support to maintain momentum
- Celebrating progress along the way!

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to schedule a brief 15-minute phone consultation to understand your specific needs and timeline. We can discuss:

- Pricing options that fit your budget

**Investment**: My services start at $299 for a 3-hour session, with longer packages available for comprehensive downsizing projects.

Are you available for a quick call this week? I can work around your schedule, including evenings if that's easier.

Looking forward to helping you make this transition smooth and successful!

Warmly,
Chanel
