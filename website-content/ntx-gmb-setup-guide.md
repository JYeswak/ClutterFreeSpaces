# Google My Business Setup Guide
## ClutterFreeSpaces - North Texas Service Area Business

**Goal:** Local search visibility for "professional organizer near me" in Denton, Ponder, Flower Mound, etc.
**Business Type:** Service Area Business (no physical storefront)
**Timeline:** 15-30 minutes to set up, 1-2 days for Google verification

---

## STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### **Step 1: Create Google Business Profile**

1. Go to: **https://business.google.com**
2. Click **"Manage now"** or **"Add your business"**
3. Sign in with Google account: `contact@clutter-free-spaces.com` (recommended) OR personal Gmail

**IMPORTANT:** Use the same Google account for Google Search Console, Analytics, etc. for easier management

---

### **Step 2: Enter Business Name**

**Business Name:** `ClutterFreeSpaces - Professional Organizing`

**Why this format:**
- Primary: ClutterFreeSpaces (brand name)
- Descriptor: Professional Organizing (helps with search)
- Clean, professional, matches Montana listing

**DON'T:**
- Add location to name (violates Google guidelines)
- Use keywords spam ("Best Organizer Denton Texas") - can get suspended
- Use all caps or special characters

---

### **Step 3: Choose Business Category**

**Primary Category:** Professional Organizer

**Search for:** "professional organizer" - it should auto-suggest

**Secondary Categories to Add (Later):**
- Home Organization Service
- Organizing Service

**Why Primary Matters:**
Google shows your business for searches related to your primary category first

---

### **Step 4: Add Location Type**

**CRITICAL CHOICE:**

Select: **"I deliver goods and services to my customers"**

Do NOT select "Customers can visit my business"

**Why:** You're a service-area business (you travel to clients, they don't come to you)

---

### **Step 5: Define Service Area**

**DO NOT enter a street address** (it will ask - skip this)

**Define Service Area:**

Option A: **Cities/Zip Codes** (Recommended)
- Denton (76201, 76205, 76207, 76208, 76209, 76210)
- Ponder (76259)
- Lewisville (75029, 75067, 75077)
- Flower Mound (75022, 75028)
- Highland Village (75077)
- Argyle (76226)
- Northlake (76262)
- Krum (76249)
- Sanger (76266)
- Aubrey (76227)
- Pilot Point (76258)
- Little Elm (75068)
- The Colony (75056)
- Corinth (76208)
- Lake Dallas (75065)

Option B: **Radius** (Alternative)
- Center point: Ponder, TX or Denton, TX
- Radius: 40-50 miles

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (specific cities) for better targeting

---

### **Step 6: Contact Information**

**Phone Number:** (406) 285-1525

**Format:** Use consistent format everywhere
- Google Business: (406) 285-1525
- Website: (406) 285-1525
- Social media: (406) 285-1525

**Why Montana number is fine:**
- Many service businesses use non-local numbers
- You can note "Montana-based, serving North Texas" in description
- Consider getting Google Voice Texas number (optional)

**Website:** www.clutter-free-spaces.com/ntx

**IMPORTANT:** This should go directly to North Texas landing page, not homepage

---

### **Step 7: Verification**

Google will ask to verify your business.

**For Service Area Businesses:**

**Option 1: Postcard Verification** (Most Common)
- Google mails postcard to business address
- Takes 5-14 days to arrive
- Contains verification code

**Problem:** You're temporarily in Texas, postcard goes to Montana

**Solution:**
- Have someone in Montana receive and text you the code
- OR use alternative verification if offered

**Option 2: Phone/Email Verification** (Sometimes Offered)
- Instant verification
- Only offered to some businesses
- If available, use this!

**Option 3: Video Verification** (Sometimes Offered)
- Record short video of business (you talking about services)
- Upload to Google
- Reviewed within 2-5 days

**What to do:**
Try to get phone/email verification. If not available, use Montana address for postcard and coordinate with someone there.

## REVIEW GENERATION STRATEGY

### **Why Reviews Matter:**
- Google ranks businesses with more reviews higher
- Reviews build trust (social proof)
- 5-star average = credibility

### **How to Get Reviews:**

**Step 1: Create Review Link**
1. Go to your GMB dashboard
2. Click "Get more reviews"
3. Copy your short review link
4. Example: `g.page/r/[your-code]/review`

**Step 2: Share Link with Clients**

**Text Message (Best Method):**
```
Hi [Client Name]! It was a pleasure organizing your home. If you have 2 minutes, would you mind leaving a quick Google review? It helps other North Texas families find me! [REVIEW LINK] Thanks so much! - Chanel
```

**Email Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Quick favor?

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you again for trusting ClutterFreeSpaces with your home! I loved creating organized systems for your [space].

If you have 2 minutes, I'd be so grateful for a Google review. It really helps other families in North Texas find my services!

[REVIEW LINK BUTTON]

Thanks so much!
Chanel
```

**Step 3: Timing**
- Send review request IMMEDIATELY after service (same day)
- Follow up 2 days later if no review
- Don't be pushy - one follow-up maximum

### **Responding to Reviews:**

**5-Star Review Response:**
```
Thank you so much, [Name]! It was a pleasure helping you create an organized [space]. So glad the systems are working for your family! Enjoy your clutter-free home! 😊 - Chanel
```

**4-Star Review Response:**
```

```

**3-Star or Below:**

```

**CRITICAL:** Always respond professionally and publicly - future clients read your responses!

## INSIGHTS & ANALYTICS

### **Check GMB Insights Weekly:**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Search Queries:** What keywords are people using to find you?
- **Views:** How many people saw your profile?
- **Actions:** How many called, visited website, requested directions?
- **Phone Calls:** How many calls from GMB?

**Access Insights:**
1. Go to GMB dashboard
2. Click "Performance" or "Insights"
3. Review last 7 days / last 30 days

**What to Optimize:**
- If low views → Post more often, add more photos
- If high views but no calls → Improve photos, description, add more services
- If getting found for wrong keywords → Adjust description/services

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Using home address** (violates Google guidelines for service businesses)
❌ **Keyword stuffing** in business name ("Best Professional Organizer Denton Texas")
❌ **Fake reviews** (Google can detect and will suspend your listing)
❌ **Not responding to reviews** (looks unprofessional)
❌ **Inconsistent NAP** (Name, Address, Phone must match everywhere online)
❌ **Ignoring Q&A** (unanswered questions hurt your ranking)
❌ **No photos** (profiles with photos get 42% more direction requests)
❌ **Not posting regularly** (inactive profiles rank lower)

---

## GMB MOBILE APP

**Download:** Google Business Profile app (iOS/Android)

**Benefits:**
- Post from your phone
- Respond to reviews instantly

- Answer Q&A quickly

## AFTER LEAVING TEXAS

### **Keep GMB Active (Even Back in Montana):**

**Update Business Description:**
```
ClutterFreeSpaces offers professional home organizing services with established expertise serving families in Montana and North Texas.

Currently based in Montana, with seasonal service in North Texas.

[Rest of description...]

North Texas availability: Check back in 2026 for next visit!
Montana services: Year-round availability
```

**Update Hours:**
- Add note: "North Texas service: Seasonal - check for availability"
- Keep GMB active (don't delete!)

**Continue Posting:**
- Monthly posts: "Planning to return to North Texas in 2026! Join waitlist"
- Share Montana transformations
- Keep profile alive for future Texas return

**Why Keep Active:**
- Builds domain authority over time
- Maintains reviews you've earned
- Easier to re-activate than start from scratch
- Shows up in "seasonal" searches

---

## IF MOVING TO TEXAS PERMANENTLY (2026)

### **Update GMB:**
1. Change from "Seasonal" to full-time availability
2. Update hours to regular schedule
3. Consider adding physical address (if applicable)
4. Update service area if needed
5. Announce on GMB: "Now permanently serving North Texas!"

**Your existing reviews, photos, and history transfer** - huge advantage!

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"My business isn't showing up in Google Maps"**
- **Solution:** Can take 1-2 weeks after verification. Be patient.
- Post regularly, add photos, get reviews to speed up indexing

### **"I can't verify my business"**
- **Solution:** Try different verification methods. Contact Google My Business support.

### **"My listing was suspended"**
- **Reason:** Usually guideline violations (keyword stuffing, fake address, etc.)
- **Solution:** Read Google guidelines, fix violations, request reinstatement

### **"Competitors have fake reviews"**
- **Solution:** Focus on getting REAL reviews. Report fake reviews if egregious.
- Don't engage in fake review tactics - Google is getting better at detecting
