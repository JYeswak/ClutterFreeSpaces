Dear Tolu,

Thank you for reaching out to ClutterFreeSpaces regarding professional organizing services for your Hamilton client's newly renovated home. I'm delighted to hear The Wiseman Group found us through Google - it's wonderful to connect with fellow professionals who prioritize creating beautiful, functional spaces for their clients.

**Professional organizing during move-in and interior design installation is one of our specialties.** We frequently collaborate with interior designers, contractors, and architects to ensure the final reveal is not only beautiful but also highly functional for the homeowners' daily lives.

## Our Move-in Organization Expertise

**For your December 8-19 timeline, we can provide:**
- **Strategic unpacking and placement** of personal belongings
- **Complete kitchen organization** with functional storage systems
- **Closet and bedroom organization** for immediate usability
- **Coordination with your installation schedule** to avoid conflicts
- **Systems setup** that homeowners can easily maintain long-term

## Our Hamilton Service Area

Hamilton is well within our service area (we serve all locations within 30 miles of Missoula), and we're very familiar with the area's homes and lifestyle needs.

## Professional Partnership Approach

**When working with design teams, we ensure:**
‚úÖ **Seamless coordination** with your installation timeline  
‚úÖ **Respect for design vision** while optimizing functionality  
‚úÖ **Professional communication** with all team members  
‚úÖ **Flexible scheduling** around contractor and delivery needs  
‚úÖ **Final walkthrough** to ensure client satisfaction  

## Next Steps

To provide you with accurate timeline and investment details, I'd love to learn more about the project scope. I've attached our **Professional Partnership Intake Form** which will help me understand:

- Home size and specific areas needing organization
- Volume of belongings to organize (moving from larger/smaller space?)
- Any special requirements or client preferences
- Your preferred coordination and communication methods
- Timeline flexibility within the December 8-19 window

**Intake Form Link**: https://form.jotform.com/251378497688176

## Investment Range

**For move-in organization projects of this scope, our services typically range from $1,200-2,400** depending on home size, volume of belongings, and specific organizational needs. We'll provide a detailed proposal once we understand the full project scope.

## Professional References

We're happy to provide references from other interior designers and contractors we've partnered with, as well as client testimonials from similar move-in organization projects.

## Scheduling

**December 8-19 works well with our schedule.** Move-in organization is most effective when coordinated closely with your installation timeline, so we can work together to determine the optimal sequencing.
