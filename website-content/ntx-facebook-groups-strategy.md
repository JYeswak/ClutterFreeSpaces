• Custom storage solutions

Rate: $75/hour with free consultation

I'd love to help! Only taking a few clients while I'm in town.

Thought this group might appreciate this transformation! 🏡

This Denton garage went from "can't even walk through" to "car parked inside" in just 4 hours.

What we did:
✓ Sorted everything (keep, donate, trash)
✓ Created functional zones (tools, seasonal, sports)
✓ Overhead storage for seasonal items
✓ Donation pile: 12 bags!

I'm a professional organizer visiting North Texas through December - helping families create spaces like this.

If you've been putting off organizing your [garage/pantry/closet], now might be the time! Limited availability.

## VALUE-FIRST COMMENT STRATEGY

### **How to Engage Without Being Salesy:**

**When Someone Posts: "Help! My house is a disaster"**

Your Comment:
```
Quick organizing tip that might help: Start with just ONE surface (kitchen counter, entryway table, nightstand). Clear it completely, then keep it clear for 3 days. You'll be amazed how much calmer you feel! Small wins build momentum 💪

(I'm a professional organizer visiting the area through December if you want hands-on help, but this tip is free! 😊)
```

**When Someone Posts: "Just moved to [area] - recommendations?"**

Your Comment:
```
Welcome to North Texas! 🎉

For organizing/unpacking help, I'm offering services through December (I'm visiting family in Ponder). Free consultation if you need help getting settled!

Also recommend:
• [Local restaurant]
• [Local service]
• [Community event]

This community is the best! You're going to love it here.
```

**When Someone Posts: "Does anyone know a [organizer/moving help/etc.]?"**

Your Comment:
```
Hi! I'm a professional organizer offering services in North Texas through December. I'd be happy to help! Free consultation to discuss your needs.

📱 (406) 285-1525

Happy to answer any questions! 😊

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS/NEGATIVITY

### **"That's expensive!"**

Response:
```
I totally understand! $75/hour isn't for everyone. If you're looking to DIY, I shared some free organizing tips in the comments above that might help! For folks who want hands-on professional help, I'm here. No pressure either way! 😊
```

### **"I could do this myself"**

Response:
```
Absolutely! Many people can. The value I provide is:
1) Objective outside perspective
2) Decision-making support (hardest part!)
3) Getting it done in hours instead of months
4) Teaching WHY so you can maintain it

But totally get if DIY is your preference! Happy to answer organizing questions anytime.
```

### **"Why should I hire someone from Montana?"**

Response:
```
Great question! I'm actually visiting family in Ponder through December, so I'm local right now. I've been organizing professionally for [X] years in Montana - just bringing that expertise to help North Texas families while I'm here! Think of it as having fresh perspective from outside the area. 😊
```

### **Competitor Comments: "I do this too!"**

Response:
```
That's awesome! North Texas has some great organizers. There's definitely enough work for all of us - every family has different needs and preferences. Best of luck with your business! 😊
```

**NEVER:** Engage in public arguments or badmouth competitors
