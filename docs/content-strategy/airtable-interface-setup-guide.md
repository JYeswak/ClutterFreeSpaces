Overdue: Due Date < today AND Status != "Completed"
High Value: Budget Range = "Over $1200" OR Budget Range = "$800-1200"
```

### Formula Fields to Add:
1. **Days Since Created:** `DATETIME_DIFF(TODAY(), {Date Created}, 'days')`
2. **Lead Age Category:** `IF({Days Since Created} <= 7, "New", IF({Days Since Created} <= 30, "Recent", "Old"))`
3. **Revenue Potential:** Based on Budget Range, assign estimated values
4. **Next Action:** Calculate next recommended action based on status and timeline

## Mobile-Friendly Setup:
- Keep dashboards simple with max 2 columns
- Use larger text and spacing
- Prioritize most important metrics at top
- Consider separate mobile interface

## Access & Permissions:
- **Admin (You):** Full access to all interfaces and data
- **Team Members:** View-only access to dashboards
- **Contractors:** Limited access to specific project data only

## Automation Triggers:
Set up Airtable automations within the interface:
1. **Hot Lead Alert:** When Lead Score >= 85, send email notification
2. **Follow-up Reminder:** When Next Follow-up date arrives, create task
3. **Project Completion:** When project marked complete, update client status

## Performance Tips:
- Limit record lists to 50-100 records for speed
- Use filters rather than showing all data
- Group related elements logically
- Test on mobile devices regularly

Once you've built these interfaces, you'll have a comprehensive visual CRM that automatically reflects all the data flowing in from your automation system!
