Base score: 20

IF space_type = "RV" THEN +25
ELSE IF space_type IN ["Home", "Office"] THEN +10

IF budget_range = "Over $1200" THEN +30
ELSE IF budget_range = "$800-1200" THEN +25
ELSE IF budget_range = "$300-800" THEN +15
ELSE IF budget_range = "Under $300" THEN +0

IF timeline = "ASAP" THEN +30
ELSE IF timeline = "2 weeks" THEN +20
ELSE IF timeline = "1 month" THEN +15
ELSE IF timeline = "2-3 months" THEN +8
ELSE IF timeline = "Exploring" THEN +2
