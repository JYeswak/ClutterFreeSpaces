## Understanding Your Space

Moving into a new home should feel like a fresh start—not a source of overwhelm. Based on your intake form, you're navigating the challenge every busy family faces: **creating functional systems that actually work for real life.** With kids, pets, and packed schedules, you need more than just "a place for everything"—you need spaces that make sense and stay organized.

You've identified the core issues clearly:
- Unpacking and placement strategy
- Functional systems for multi-generational use
- Decluttering with purpose
- Creating sustainable organization habits

**This is exactly what we do.**

## Our Approach

ClutterFreeSpaces brings a systematic, judgment-free methodology to your 2,000 sq ft home. We don't just arrange items—we engineer systems around *how you actually live*.

### What You'll Experience:

**Day 1 - Strategic Assessment & High-Impact Zones**
We start where it matters most. Together, we'll identify pain points, assess what stays and what goes, and tackle your highest-priority spaces. Expect immediate visible progress.

**Days 2-3 - System Implementation & Optimization**
We'll create intuitive zones for your family's daily routines. Kid-friendly accessibility. Adult efficiency. Pet-proofing where needed. Every decision is made with your input and lifestyle in mind.

**Ongoing Support**
Post-project check-in to ensure systems are holding. Adjustments as your family settles in. You're not just getting organized—you're learning to *stay* organized.
