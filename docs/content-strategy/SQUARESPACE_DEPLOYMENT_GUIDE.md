```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'https://www.clutter-free-spaces.com',
    'https://clutter-free-spaces.com', 
    'https://clutter-free-spaces.squarespace.com',
    'http://localhost:3001' // Keep for testing
  ],

```bash
curl https://your-production-url.com/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}`
