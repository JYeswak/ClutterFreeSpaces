  else if (lead.budget >= 300) score += 10;

  else if (lead.timeline === "month") score += 10;
  
  // Project Type Score (Max: 20 points)
  if (lead.type === "RV") score += 20; // Premium service
  else if (lead.type === "downsizing") score += 20; // Urgent
  else if (lead.type === "whole_home") score += 15;
  else score += 5;
  
  // Engagement Score (Max: 15 points)
  if (lead.completedChat) score += 10;
