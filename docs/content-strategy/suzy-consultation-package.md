Hi Suzy,

Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me tonight! I really enjoyed learning about your downsizing project and I'm excited about helping you achieve your September 13th garage sale goal.

As we discussed, I think the [CHOSEN PACKAGE] would be perfect for your timeline and needs. This gives us [X hours] to focus on the priority areas we identified and get everything ready for a successful garage sale.

Based on our conversation, here's what I recommend for our first session:
- Focus on [specific areas/categories]
- Use ADHD-friendly sorting systems we discussed
- Set up garage sale pricing strategy
- Schedule donation pickup for items we won't sell

I have availability [specific dates/times] this week to get started. Given your timeline, I'd recommend we begin by [specific date] to ensure we have plenty of time for a stress-free preparation.

Please let me know if you'd like to move forward and which day works best for our first session!

Looking forward to helping you make this transition smooth and successful.

Warmly,
