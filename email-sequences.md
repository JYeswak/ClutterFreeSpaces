Hi {Name},

Want to see something amazing?

Last week, I helped Sarah from Billings transform her 32-foot travel trailer. She was literally in tears (happy ones!) when we finished.

[BEFORE PHOTO] ‚Üí [AFTER PHOTO]

Sarah's biggest challenge? "I couldn't find anything, and my husband was ready to sell the RV!"

Here's what we did:
‚úì Created zones for each family member
‚úì Installed custom storage solutions ($47 total!)
‚úì Labeled everything with her Cricut
‚úì Set up a simple maintenance system

The result? They're now full-timing and LOVING it.

**What Sarah says:**
"I wish we'd called Chanel sooner. She turned our cramped RV into a functional home. Worth every penny!"

Ready for your transformation?

Or reply with your biggest organization challenge - I love brainstorming solutions!

Organized wishes,

Chanel

P.S. Sarah's project took 6 hours and cost $640. Most projects range from $300-800.

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- The #1 Mistake Montana RVers Make With Storage
- Why Your Organization Systems Keep Failing
- The 10-Minute Trick That Changed Everything

```html
{Name},

Can I share a secret?

90% of organization failures happen because of ONE mistake:

**Creating systems for who you WANT to be, not who you ARE.**

Here's what I mean:

‚ùå WRONG: "I'll fold clothes perfectly like Marie Kondo"
‚úÖ RIGHT: "I'll use bins because I'm a tosser, not a folder"

‚ùå WRONG: "I'll maintain a complex filing system"
‚úÖ RIGHT: "Three bins: NOW, SOON, SOMEDAY"

‚ùå WRONG: "I'll clean out the RV basement monthly"
‚úÖ RIGHT: "Clear bins so I can SEE when it's getting cluttered"

The magic happens when we design around YOUR actual habits.

That's exactly what I do during our consultation:
1. Understand how you really live
2. Design systems that work WITH your habits
3. Create solutions you'll actually maintain

P.S. Fun fact: I'm naturally messy! That's why my systems WORK - they're designed for real humans, not Pinterest boards.

This month, I'm offering a "Quick Win" session:
- 3 hours of hands-on organizing
- We tackle your WORST area
