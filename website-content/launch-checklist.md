## Inquiry Response Template

**When someone texts/calls:**
```
Hi [Name]! Thanks for reaching out about organizing services. I'd love to help you create a functional, clutter-free space!

I have limited availability through December (currently [X] spots remaining).

Would you be available for a quick 15-20 min call to discuss your needs? I can usually chat:
- [Day] between [time]
- [Day] between [time]

What works best for you?

Looking forward to connecting!
- Chanel
```

**When someone asks about pricing:**
```
Great question! My rate is $75/hour and most projects range from 4-8 hours depending on the space and goals.

I always start with a free consultation so we can:
✓ Walk through your space (virtual or in-person)
✓ Discuss your specific challenges
✓ Create a realistic plan and timeline
✓ Determine estimated hours/investment

Would you like to schedule a quick consultation call? No obligation - just a chance to see if we're a good fit!
```

**When someone says "I'll think about it":**
```
Absolutely! Take the time you need. Just a heads up - I only have [X] spots available during this 6-week visit, so if you're seriously considering it, I'd recommend reaching out sooner rather than later.

Feel free to text me any questions in the meantime! No pressure at all 😊
```
