"Hi Denton County Moms! 👋

My name is Chanel and I'm a professional organizer from Montana visiting family in Ponder through December. While I'm here, I'm offering organizing services to help local families.

I know how overwhelming it feels when your home doesn't work for you - especially with kids, pets, and busy schedules! I specialize in creating functional systems for real families (not Pinterest-perfect solutions that fall apart in a week).

If you're:
• Still unpacking from a move
• Drowning in toy clutter
• Prepping for holiday guests
• Just needing a fresh start

I'd love to help! Zero judgment, hands-on support, and systems built for your actual life.

Only taking a few clients while I'm in town. Free consultation to chat about your needs.

Instead of organizing by category (all toys together), try organizing by ACTIVITY:

Makes transitions SO much smoother!
