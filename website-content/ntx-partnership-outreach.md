## REAL ESTATE AGENT OUTREACH

### **Email Template #1: Initial Introduction**

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Add Value to Your Denton Buyers - Limited Time Service"
- "Professional Unpacking Service for Your Clients"
- "Partner Opportunity: Moving Made Easier for Your Buyers"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Agent Name],

I'm Chanel Boylan, a professional organizer from Montana visiting family in the Denton/Ponder area through December.

While I'm here, I'm offering organizing and unpacking services to North Texas families - and I thought this might add value to your buyer clients.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
Many of your buyers are overwhelmed after closing - boxes everywhere, don't know where to start, working full-time while trying to settle in.

I offer:
• Professional unpacking services ($75/hour)
• Systematic room-by-room organization
• Custom storage solutions
• Move-in ready setup in days, not months

THE VALUE FOR YOU:
• Differentiate your service (not all agents offer this!)
• Happier clients who settle in faster
• Referral bonus: $50 per booked client
• Free 1-hour consultation for your next closing

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to discuss how we might collaborate?

I'm only in North Texas through December, so this is a limited-time partnership opportunity.

Best regards,
Chanel Boylan

P.S. - Montana agent I worked with said this was the #1 value-add her buyers appreciated post-closing!

### **Email Template #3: Value-Add Offer**

**Subject Line:** "Free gift for your next buyer closing"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Agent Name],

I know you're busy, so I'll make this simple:

OFFER FOR YOUR NEXT CLOSING:
FREE 1-hour organizing consultation for your buyer ($75 value)

No strings attached. I want to show you (and them) the value of professional organizing services post-move.

After they experience it, they'll likely book more hours - and you'll earn $50 referral credit.

Win-win-win: You differentiate your service, they get help, I get a client.

Your next closing happening soon?

Text me: (406) 285-1525

Best,
Chanel

## MOVING COMPANY OUTREACH

### **Email Template: Moving Company Partnership**

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Add-On Service for Your Moving Clients"
- "Increase Revenue Per Move - Unpacking Services"
- "Partnership Opportunity: [Moving Company Name] + ClutterFreeSpaces"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Contact Name],

I'm Chanel, a professional organizer offering unpacking and organization services in North Texas through December.

I'd love to explore a partnership with [Moving Company Name].

THE OPPORTUNITY:
Most of your clients need MORE than just boxes moved - they need help unpacking and setting up their new homes.

Right now, that revenue goes to... nobody (they struggle through it themselves for weeks/months).

PARTNERSHIP IDEA:
• You refer unpacking/organizing services after the move
• I provide seamless experience for your mutual clients
• You earn 15% referral commission on booked services
• Or: We co-market "White Glove Move" package (moving + organizing)

BENEFITS FOR YOU:
✓ Additional revenue stream
✓ Differentiate from competitors
✓ Higher customer satisfaction (they remember seamless moves!)
✓ Repeat business from happier clients

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss?

I'm only in North Texas through December, but if this works well, we could continue the partnership when I return in 2026.

Best regards,
Chanel Boylan

### **Follow-Up Email (Moving Companies)**

**Subject Line:** "Quick question about [Moving Company Name] services"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Contact Name],

Quick follow-up on my partnership proposal.

One question: What do your clients ask for AFTER the move is complete?

In my experience, 80% of moving clients wish they had help unpacking and organizing.

That's exactly what I offer - and I'd love to be YOUR referral partner for those situations.

15% commission on every booked client I refer back to you for future moves too!

Available for a quick call this week?

Best,
Chanel

## STORAGE FACILITY OUTREACH

### **Email Template: Storage Facility Partnership**

**Subject Line:** "Help Your Customers Downsize Smarter"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Manager Name],

I'm Chanel, a professional organizer serving North Texas through December.

I'm reaching out because many of your customers are storing items they don't actually need - costing them money every month.

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
• I offer "Storage Unit Audit" service
• Help customers declutter BEFORE storing (or downsize existing units)
• Many reduce storage needs by 30-50%
• You retain happy customers (instead of frustrated ones canceling)

HOW IT WORKS:
• You recommend my services to customers considering storage or upgrading units
• I help them declutter/organize to minimize storage needs
• They store only what's truly necessary
• You keep long-term satisfied customers (not resentful ones)
• I offer your customers 10% discount

Plus: I refer clients TO you when they need proper storage solutions for items worth keeping!

Interested in exploring this? Quick call this week?

Best,
Chanel Boylan

## HOME STAGER OUTREACH

### **Email Template: Home Stager Collaboration**

**Subject Line:** "Organize BEFORE Staging - Better Results for Your Clients"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Stager Name],

I'm Chanel, a professional organizer in North Texas through December.

I'd love to collaborate with you on challenging staging projects.

THE PROBLEM:
You're hired to stage homes, but sometimes the homeowner's clutter makes it nearly impossible to showcase the space properly.

THE SOLUTION:
I come in FIRST to:
• Declutter and organize
• Pack away personal items
• Create clean slate for your staging work

Result: Your staging looks AMAZING (and you don't waste time moving their clutter around)

COLLABORATION IDEA:
• Offer combined "Declutter + Stage" package
• I handle organization/packing
• You handle beautiful staging
• Split revenue or referral commission

We both get more business, clients get better results!

Available for coffee this week to discuss?

Best regards,
Chanel

## PROPERTY INSPECTOR OUTREACH

### **Email Template: Property Inspector Partnership**

**Subject Line:** "Your Clients Need This After the Inspection"

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Inspector Name],

I'm Chanel, a professional organizer serving Denton and surrounding areas through December.

Here's why I'm reaching out:

After you complete inspections, homeowners often have recommended repairs, maintenance items, and organization needs.

Many are overwhelmed and don't know where to start - especially with garages, attics, basements that need clearing for repairs.

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
• You refer organizing services for pre-repair clearing
• I help homeowners tackle organization punch-lists
• You provide value-added service (clients remember this!)
• I offer your referrals 10% discount

BONUS: I refer clients back to you for re-inspections or when they ask "who should I hire for [repair]?"

Quick call to discuss?

Best,
Chanel Boylan

"Perfect! That means you have clients who could use this service. Can I send you my info so you can refer when the timing is right?"
