        <p>Hi {{first_name}},</p>

        <p>Many families want their loved ones to age in place safely and independently, but cluttered or disorganized homes can create additional challenges. A well-organized environment can help support daily living and reduce stress for everyone involved.</p>

            <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;"><strong>Success Story:</strong> We recently worked with a Kalispell family whose 82-year-old father was struggling with medication management. After organizing his bedroom and bathroom with clear systems, his adherence improved dramatically, and his home health aide could deliver care much more efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I understand the importance of working collaboratively with healthcare teams and always coordinate with existing care providers. Many Montana home health agencies have found that professional organizing enhances their clients' quality of life and safety outcomes.</p>
